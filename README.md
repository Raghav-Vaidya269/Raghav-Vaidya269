# Hi, I’m Raghav Vaidya

I’m a Computer Science student at Kathmandu University who enjoys understanding **how things work under the hood** — not just using tools, but questioning them.

Right now, I’m diving into **web backend development**, where logic, data, and real-world constraints collide in interesting ways. 

I learn best by building, breaking, and rebuilding — each project is an excuse to go a little deeper than last time.

## 🧠 What I’m Focused On
- Backend development with Node.js & Express  
- Designing databases that don’t collapse under bad assumptions  
- Writing code that is readable *and* correct  
- Turning “I kind of get it” into “I can explain it”
